# Code Retreat

Template project for a Java Code-Retreat with JUnit 5.

It comes preloaded with two choices of assertion libraries:
* **Raw JUnit Assertions class:** uncomment `JUNIT[1/2]` and `JUNIT[2/2]` in GameOfLifeTest
* **AssertJ:** uncomment the `ASSERTJ[1/3]` dependency in pom.xml plus `ASSERTJ[2/3]` & `ASSERTJ[2/3]` in GameOfLifeTest

If needed, uncomment the Lombok dependency in pom.xml
Note that Lombok is not advised for Code Retreat, so you can better control encapsulation.
